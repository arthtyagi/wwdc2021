Ok so, this was going to be my WWDC '21 submission but I'm not done with this yet and I don't want to build a crappy version of what I have in mind so I've got a new plan.

## Plan 

- Build a fictional space company
- Simple Rocket Science Lessons ( from NASA's website and other public-domain information )
- Rocket simulator that's gonna look reallyyyyyy fuckin cool especially with ARKit.
- Keep creating on top of it. Repeat last step.


Publish the app to App Store! I think this sounds like a much better plan.

### Development Checklist

- [ ] Nice Splash Screen
- [ ] Practical Rocketery into mini-lessons for the general audience
- [ ] Cool graphs with subtle animation
- [ ] Rocket Simulator with Arcade-games esque graphics
- [ ] AR Kit


### Timeline

- Start off after [ConnectDome](https://connectdome.com/)'s Beta Launch ( probably May ).
- Timeframe of 8 weeks to finish this after my exams? ( Let's just say this'll be finished by August? )

Note : I'm still commiting the Playground I built after learning Swift for a few days.
